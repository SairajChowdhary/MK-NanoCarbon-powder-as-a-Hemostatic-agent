# MK-N220 Nanoparticles as a Hemostatic Agent
This repository contains details of a research project by Sairaj on the use of MK-N220 nanoparticles as an effective hemostatic agent to improve blood clotting. The project, supervised by Dr. Shantanu Kumar Behera, outlines the synthesis, characterisation, and application of these nanoparticles.

The project utilises a multi-stage Polymer-Derived Ceramics (PDC) route to create a nanocomposite powder. The process involves mixing MK powder and N220 Nano-Carbon with ethanol, followed by cross-linking and heat treatment at various temperatures.

# Characterisation
The research includes a thorough structural and micro-structural analysis. Techniques such as XRD and Raman Spectroscopy were used to confirm the presence of both amorphous and graphitic carbon. FESEM analysis provided insights into the morphology and crystallinity of the nanoparticles.

# Hemostatic Application: 
The core finding of the project is the significant ability of these nanoparticles to accelerate blood clotting. The study showed a notable reduction in clotting time, with samples treated at higher temperatures (NMK11 and NMK12) exhibiting the most potent hemostatic effect.

# Future Work: 
The project outlines future research directions, including BET surface area analysis, ex-vivo studies, and Prothrombin Time (PT) tests to further validate the material for potential clinical use.
